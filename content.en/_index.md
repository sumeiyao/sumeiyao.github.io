# Hello ðŸ‘‹

**Welcome to Sumei's  personal website!**

I'm Sumei Yao, a Ph.D candidate from the School of Information Management at Wuhan University. Currently, I am undertaking a one-year doctoral exchange program at ETH Zurich.

My research focuses on machine learning applications in biomedical natural language processing and clinical data mining, with a particular interest in developing algorithms for problem adaptation. Information gathering, processing, organization, mining, and application are essential skills I've honed as a doctoral candidate in information science, while biomedical research continues to uncover the mysteries of life. I would greatly eager to mining shining ideas and findings in the intersection of the two area.
